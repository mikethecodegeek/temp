                    <p>Weâ€™re not fortune tellers, so there are a couple things we canâ€™t account for. How long it will take for your phone to ship to us is one of them (depending on where you are, it usually takes between one and five days). What type of payment method you choose, and how long it takes to deposit in your account or ship the check is another\What we CAN tell you is that we have someone inspecting the devices 7 days a week, and from inspection to getting accounting to process the payment is about 48 hours. </p>

If you canâ€™t find your device you can always check back with us later, but unfortunately we donâ€™t need it right now. PRETTY PLEASE donâ€™t just pick a device from our list that is similar to yours if you canâ€™t find the one you have. We promise weâ€™ll notice when we inspect it (thatâ€™s kinda our job), and we wonâ€™t be able to pay you for it. And then everyone involved has to wear a sad, sad face ðŸ˜ž</p>
