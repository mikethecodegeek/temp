		<p>You’ve upgraded your device and you’re feeling pretty good about it, until you realize you don’t know what to do with the one you’re replacing. You could stuff it in a junk drawer, give it away, or try to coordinate pick-up times at your home where you haggle over prices with some online strangers. If none of those feel right to you, we have a better option.</p>

		<p>We purchase and refurbish cell phones and tablets, and coordinate with our partner wholesale company to distribute them. It’s good for the environment. It’s good for our buyers. It’s good for your pocket-book (do people even still carry pocket-books?).</p>

		<p>We’re a Canadian company (eh) based in Toronto. We love geeking out on tech, long walks on the beach, and the satisfaction of a job well done.</p>

		<p>Of course, what you really want to know is how all this goes down for you. So here it is:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Get a free, instant quote. Our website walks you through all of the devices we want to purchase and how much we are willing to pay for them based on their condition. This makes it super-duper easy for us to work with lots of Canadian’s and offer the most money for your device.</li>
			<li>Pick from our available payment methods and order a shipping label.</li>
			<li>Package your device, and ship it off to us free of charge.</li>
			<li>Once we’ve inspected it, accounting will process your payment. </li>
			<li>You receive your money! Do whatever you do with your money - save it, spend it, donate it, bury it in the backyard. It’s all good to us.</li>
			<li>Bonus points - tell your family, friends, followers, coworkers and grocery clerk how easy it was to work with us and how rad you think we are. You’ll get the reward of knowing that we think you’re pretty rad, too.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>So what are you waiting for? Tell us about your device and we’ll tell you how much we’ll pay you for it with an <a ui-sref="sell">instant quote.</a> </p>
